# A Tool for Managing Research Outputs CBIB

The purpose of this project is to create a web-based tool for managing the research outputs produced by the members of the Centre for Artificial Intelligence Research (CAIR) - a virtual South African Research Centre, hosted at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). The centre has nodes at several universities in the country. The goal of this organisation is to bring together the peer reviewed research work of scientists, researchers and students across the country in order to contribute to the advancement of AI research in South Africa. CAIR stores and maintains these research papers on their website (cair.org.za) and they are available to the general public to read and download for free.
